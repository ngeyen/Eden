# the eden mini programming language
A BASIC-type programming language using python 3.8
The Beginners' All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code (BASIC) was first designed by John G. Kemeny and Thomas E. Kurtz.
The core phylosophy of BASIC emphasizes ease of use. I found a video on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/Eythq9848Fg?list=PLZQftyCk7_SdoVexSmwy_tBgs7P0b97y)
in which the instructor implemented the BASIC programming language in python and I was so interested in the project and decided to follow along and 
implement it in my own way adding and removing certain elements of the code to produce my own mini language I call eden :)
This project has really helped me understand programming languages more.
